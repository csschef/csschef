<img src="https://flagcdn.com/w20/se.png"/> Based in Kalmar, Sweden  

Currently studying at **Medieinstitutet** to become a Fullstack Developer.

Alongside my studies, I work as a **Master Data Administrator in the food industry**.  
Outside of work and school, I explore **Home Assistant**, automation, and modern web technologies.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually cooking, renovating, gaming, or spending time with my family.
