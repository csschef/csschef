##  About me
I'm from Sweden ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4eecd41-aeb8-48f6-940c-8f800db9d4da). I'm currently studying to become a fullstack developer. Between my job as a product developer for the food industry and school, I'm deep into Home Assistant and love home automation. When I'm not writing code, I can be found in the kitchen cooking or baking :man_cook:, renovating the house :hammer:, enjoying a videogame :video_game:, or spending time with my two daughters and lovely partner. 

## I'm currently learning
VSCode and freshing up on my html and CSS skills.
