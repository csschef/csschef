### About me
I'm from Sweden. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4eecd41-aeb8-48f6-940c-8f800db9d4da) I'm currently studying to become a fullstack developer. Between my job as a product developer for the food industry and school, I'm deep into Home Assistant and love home automation. When I'm not writing code, I can be found in the kitchen cooking or baking :man_cook:, renovating the house :hammer:, enjoying a videogame :video_game:, or spending time with my two daughters and lovely partner. 

### I'm currently learning
VSCode and freshing up on my html and CSS skills.

### My projects :wrench:

[gameboxbar.se](https://gameboxbar.se) is a moc up website for a fictional game bar company.

[pizzakalkylator.se](https://pizzakalkylator.se) is a simple pizza calculator to allow for ease of use when scaling dough and returning accurate required amount of yeast based on surrounding temperature of the dough throughout the fermentation and proofing time.

### Like what I'm doing?
Consider giving me a coffe to keep the engine running
