### About me
I'm from Sweden. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4eecd41-aeb8-48f6-940c-8f800db9d4da) I'm currently studying at Medieinstitutet to become a fullstack developer. Between my job as a master data administrator for the food industry and school, I'm deep into Home Assistant and love home automation.
